libuv is a cross-platform C support library focusing on asynchronous I/O. It was primarily developed for Node.js. It offers the same API on Windows and Linux.

These examples track my reading and learning from nikhilm's book here:

Why learn about the libuv library? NodeJs uses the libuv library to implement its mainn event loop.
